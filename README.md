# Interface Development Test

## Design assets
* Invision public URL: https://invis.io/N312IJ0C8GMK
* Assets used in the build have been packaged under the `/assets` folder.

## Test instructions
In the linked Invision page you will find the designs for two components. Complete the following:
* The code should be submitted via a github account. Bonus points for more than one commit.
* Build the two blocks using modern HTML5 standards.
* Use JavaScript to capture all anchor clicks, and `console.log()` the element which has been clicked.
* As with any modern web-build we expect a level of interactivity/animation to be displayed on the nodes.
* All content areas should be deemed as being populated from a CMS - so all copy lengths can vary!

## Technologies
* Any CSS-preprocessors or frameworks.
* ES5 or ES6+ acceptable.
* Please include some reasoning for the decisions via comments or readme.
* Build tools and task runners are encouraged (e.g. grunt/gulp/webpack).

## Layout
* The layout is expected to work in the latest Chrome/FireFox/Edge versions.
* The layout should be responsive and work down to a `320px` mobile device.
* Bearing in mind that this application is expected to be responsive, the developer should consider the appropriate `<meta>` tags.
* **Section: All the latest:** Assume these items need anchor tags, but have no link defined.
* **Section: Answer your body's needs:** Each image in this section should display in a modal on click.

## Review Criteria
We are looking for your ability to bring life to static designs. During that process consider the following:
* **Project structure:** Clean project and logical traversal.
* **JavaScript:** Efficiency of code and efficacy in bringing the design to life.
* **Interface:** Semantic markup styling.
* **Git:** Bonus points for submission on a github account showing multiple commits.
* **Quality:** Production-grade build and precision.
